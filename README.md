# Spell Checker


The need for the system to be developed is due to the fact that common typing errors are made by users across devices frequently hence making important messages and files riddled with typos. This also reduces the accuracy while using search terms.

Our objective is to check whether the word entered is present in the dictionary and if it is not, provide a list of alternatives of what the word was meant to be.

This objective is fulfilled by 

•	implementing the Metaphone algorithm which was made by Lawrence Phillips and 

•	finding the edit distance of the entered word with respect to a list of alternative words in order to choose the most probable word.

This system will help in increasing the readability of any electronically written material of the client or user and reduce typing errors.
